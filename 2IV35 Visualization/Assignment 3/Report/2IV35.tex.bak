\section*{Information Visualization}
In this report we will describe how we implemented a web application for visualizing a large data set for the course 2IV35. This data set contains information about certain patients and certain diseases that ales them. \newline
The data that is available is per patient there temperature, Occurrence of nausea, Lumbar pain, Urine pushing, Micturition pains,  Burning of urethra, itch, swelling of urethra outlet, decision: Inflammation of urinary bladder and decision: Nephritis of renal pelvis origin \newline
In section 1, we will first give a description of the format of the data set. \newline
In section 2, we will explain our design considerations for the interface. \newline
In section 3, we will present our actual implementation, with screenshots and motivation. \newline
Finally in section 5, we will show how our visualization can be usefull. \newline
\newpage
\section{Description of the Dataset}
We have been given a dataset with information about certain patients and certain diseases that ales them. The data is provided in a .csv file with 120 rows and 8 columns every column is separated by a tab. Every row represents a patient. There is also a .txt file with a more detailed explanation of how the data in the .csv can be read.
\subsection{High-level description}
Our data set is called "inflammation.csv" and it describes patients and the diseases that ales them. There are 8 columns that represent the diseases and there are 120 rows that represent the patients. The data from the 2nd to the 8th column are "yes" to indicate that he has the disease of that column or "no" to indicate that he doesn't have the disease that the column represents. For example: \newline
\textbf{'35,9 no no yes yes yes yes no'} \newline
Where: \newline
'35,9' Temperature of patient \newline
'no' Occurrence of nausea \newline
'no' Lumbar pain \newline
'yes' Urine pushing (continuous need for urination) \newline
'yes' Micturition pains \newline
'yes' Burning of urethra, itch, swelling of urethra outlet \newline
'yes' decision: Inflammation of urinary bladder \newline
'no' decision: Nephritis of renal pelvis origin  \newline

\subsection{Description of the format}
The data has been gathered from a paper about diagnosis of urinary system diseases \footnote{J.Czerniak, H.Zarzycki, Application of rough sets in the presumptive diagnosis of urinary system diseases, Artifical Inteligence and Security in Computing Systems, ACS'2002 9th International Conference Proceedings, Kluwer Academic Publishers,2003, pp. 41-51} \newline
take from the dataset: \newline
The main idea of this data set is to prepare the algorithm of the expert system, which will perform the presumptive diagnosis of two diseases of urinary system. It will be the example of diagnosing of the acute inflammations of urinary bladder and acute nephritises. For better understanding of the problem let us consider definitions of both diseases given by medics. Acute inflammation of urinary bladder is characterised by sudden occurrence of pains in the abdomen region and the urination in form of constant urine pushing, micturition pains and sometimes lack of urine keeping. Temperature of the body is rising, however most often not above 38C. The excreted urine is turbid and sometimes bloody. At proper treatment, symptoms decay usually within
several days. However, there is inclination to returns. At persons with acute inflammation of urinary bladder, we should expect that the illness will turn into protracted form. \newline
Acute nephritis of renal pelvis origin occurs considerably more often at women than at men. It begins with sudden fever, which reaches, and sometimes exceeds 40C. The fever is accompanied by shivers and one- or both-side lumbar pains, which are sometimes very strong. Symptoms of acute inflammation of urinary bladder appear very often. Quite not infrequently there are nausea and vomiting and spread pains of whole abdomen. \newline
The data was created by a medical expert as a data set to test the expert system, which will perform the presumptive diagnosis of two diseases of urinary system. The basis for rules detection was Rough Sets Theory. Each instance represents an potential patient. \newline
Attribute Information: \newline
a1 Temperature of patient { 35C-42C } \newline
a2 Occurrence of nausea { yes, no } \newline
a3 Lumbar pain { yes, no } \newline
a4 Urine pushing (continuous need for urination) { yes, no } \newline
a5 Micturition pains { yes, no } \newline
a6 Burning of urethra, itch, swelling of urethra outlet { yes, no } \newline
d1 decision: Inflammation of urinary bladder { yes, no } \newline
d2 decision: Nephritis of renal pelvis origin { yes, no } \newline
\newpage
\section{Design}
In this section we explain the general design of the visualization.
\subsection{General design}
What the goal is with the visualization is finding a correlation between the data, for instance between the temperature and the diseases that the patients tend to have. For this we used a bar chart, a chord diagram and parallel coordinates. We also implemented a slider that allows the user to determine a temperature range for which the data will be visualized.
\subsection{User Interface}
There a many municipalities and there is a lot of data. Showing this at once for all municipalities makes the visualizations to complex and hard to inspect. Therefor we needed an interface that allows the user to scroll through the data and select some aspects of the data that needs to be visualized. To support these actions on the visualizations we needed an interface. \newline
We started with a map of the Netherlands showing all municipalities. This map is used to scroll to the municipalities by clicking them. After clicking a municipalities the data selected is shown.  Since we also want to make comparisons between municipalities, the ability to select two municipalities was added. When selecting two municipalities, the data of these two is added in one visualization. This approach makes it easy for the user to compare data between municipalities. \newline
Since it is not useful to show all the data of a municipality at once, also an interface is needed to give the user to be ability to select some aspects about the data. In this case where there are not to many categories radio buttons is a good approach. Since they are small enough to place it direct in the visualization. This way the user gets a direct overview of the data and options available for the visualization without going through dropdown or list constructions. Selecting an aspect of the data would recolor the map to show an average overview of the data. This enables the user to find interesting municipalities and select them to get more detail of the data.
\newpage
\section{Data Representation}
We tried to display as much useful and interesting data as we could from the cities-data.txt file, the data we don't use from the data as seen in the table is: \textbf{WATER, OAD, STED, AANTAL HH, P EENP HH, P HH Z K, AUTO HH and OPP TOT}. \newline
Inside the data there were certain data aspects that were not given for certain city regions, for those entries the value became a big number like -99999997.0, also a row in the file had no function and could cause a misrepresentation of the data visualization. Because we didn't want to change the dataset given, we choose to identify the flaws and solve them in the coding of the visualization. \newline
\newpage
\section{Implementation}

                \caption{visualization interface}
        \end{subfigure} \newline
        \caption{Radiobuttons}
\end{wrapfigure}
We decided to to the implementation in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the reasoning for this is because this way users will be able to visit the visualization easily using their web brower, without needing to install additional software. \newline
For the visualization of data, we used the d3.js library. This library allows users to handle data in JavaScript easily. For the visualization we also used the scripts dimple.js and d3pie.js, these use the d3.js library and allow you to take full advantage of the power and flexibility of d3 to visualize data. \newline
We had to use a range of visualizations to display useful data from the give dataset. For this we used the heatmap of the netherlands, a barchart, a scatter plot and a piechart. \newline
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}
        \centering
        \begin{subfigure}[h]{0.12\textwidth}

        \end{subfigure}
        \caption{visualization}
\end{wrapfigure}
\subsection{Technical Notes}
We have tested the application in Firefox and Chrome. Other modern browsers like Safari, Opera and Internet Explorer should also support our application, but we have not tested that. \newline
The visualization can be viewed by everyone, if you go to the site "www.isitsunday.com/2IV35.html" (use capital "IV") it will load the visualization we have made for the course 2IV35. How long the link will be supported can not be said at this time. \newline
\subsection{Main Interface}
The interface that's implemented for this visualization is all realized with radiobutton's. You have the map of the Netherlands and with radiobutton's on the left side of the map you can make a decision of the data that is represented in the map (a). The map of the Netherlands will always be visible, so that means that the button's also will always be visible, so you are always able to change the data visualized in the map. There are also 3 radiobuttons on the top right of the map (b), these allow you to change the visualization that is visible on the left of the map, on default this is the scatter map, but you can change it to Bar chart visualization and pie chart visualization. \newline
The radiobutton interface of the heatmap and of the visualization selection can be seen in the figure below and are visible at all times.\newline
The 3 visualizations that can be chosen between are scatter plots, bar charts and pie charts, for every chosen interface a new interface will become visible on the top left of that visualization for the 3 visualizations the interfaces can be seen in the figure below. \newline
\subsection{HeatMap of the Netherlands}
For this assignment we were provided some basic code which would use the json file and draw the coordinates of the city region, which when combined represented the Netherlands. This has been modified in such a way that the city region changes colour when moused over and that every city region is clickable. The map will always be visible in the visualization, because the barchart and the piechart require input given from the map. \newline
We have also included multiple datasets to be visualized in the heatmap. These have been split in 3 sections: General, inhabitants descendants and household information sectinos. \newline
The General section includes: "number of inhabitants"(a), "land/water ratio"(b), "percentage households with children"(c), "density"(d) and "male/female ratio"(e). \newline
The inhabitants descendants section includes: "Europe and America"(f), "Not Europe, America, Oceania, Indonesia and Japan"(g), "Maroccans"(h), "Antilles"(i), "Surinames"(j), "Turkish"(k) and "Countries not mentioned above"(l). \newline
and the household information section includes: "not married ratio"(m), "married ratio"(n), "divorced ratio"(o) and "widowed ratio"(p). The letter after the data represents it's location in the figure displaying the heatmaps. \newline
We chose this data to be the most interesting and we decided not to add more choices to the list because it would be to much and it would diminish the data that was represented. Data we considered to display but were not included were The Age range (a separate heatmap for every range) This has already been displayed in the barchart and the number of cars and motorcycles because it has been portrait in the scatter map. \newline
All of the data that has been displayed in shown in the figure below. \newline

\end{figure}
\subsection{Scatter Plot}
The second visualization which on default is visible when running the site is a scatter plot, there are 2 options for the scatter plot as explained in the interface chapter, these options are company cars and motorcycles. \newline
When selecting the company cars scatter plot, you will see the scatter plot of the total cars put against the number of company cars, every city region is a bubble and the size of the bubble represents the number of inhabitants. When selecting the Motorcycles the plot is similar, except instead of company cars, the number of motorcycles is displayed. You can mouseover a bubble, than a label will appear with the data of that bubble, so the name, inhabitants, total cars and total company cars/motorcycles. a line will be drawn across the x and y axis so you can better see at what point on the x and y axis the bubble is located. \newline
The results of the 2 scatter plots can be seen in the figure below. with the company cars (a) and the motorcycles (b). \newline
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{1\textwidth}

\subsection{Bar Chart}
The third visualization is a barchart where the age range percentage are displayed. You can select between simple and extended as described in the interface section. When the simple chart is selected you see the age range from 0-14 to 65 and older and with the extended chart selected you see the age range from 0 to 4, 5 to 9 all the way to 95 and older. \newline
\newline
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{1\textwidth}
        \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.23\textwidth}

                \label{fig:smallExtended}

        \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.23\textwidth}
                \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Visualization/BarChartExtendedSingle.png}
                \caption{big single}
                \label{fig:bigSingle}

        \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.23\textwidth}
                \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Visualization/BarChartExtendedFull.png}
                \caption{big extended}
                \label{fig:bigExtended}
        \end{subfigure}
        \caption{Scatter plots}\label{fig:BarCharts}
\end{wrapfigure}
\newline
\newline
\newline
\newline
\newline
\newline
\newline
\newline
\newline
\newline
You give the barchart input by clicking on the map, which is always visible on the left side of the screen, by clicking on a city region, the age range data of that region is loaded in the barchart. When a second city region is selected both the data of that city region and the previous city region is loaded in the barchart and they are given a different colour and a label to identify which colour is which city region. By double clicking a city region, you will see only the data of that city region. \newline
So you can have 1 city region displayed with simple data (a) or extended data (c), or you can see 2 city regions next to each other with simple data (b) or with extended data (d) as seen in the figure. \newline
\subsection{Pie Chart}
The fourth visualization is the piechart where 4 different kind of data is visualized, the datasets that are displayed are kept small, because otherwise the piechart would lose it's use. The first data that is visualized is the marriage data, so the percentage that is either married, not married, divorced or widowed. The second data that is visualized is the male/female ratio for that city region. The third data is the inhabitants ratio between the last 2 selected city regions. And the fourth data is the land/water ratio of the given cityregion. \newline
Again you give input by clicking on the map that's always visible on the left side and the city region that is clicked will be the input for the data shown in the piecharts, also you can switch between the four data options by clicking the radiobutton's as described in the interface. In the figure you see an example of the married ratio pie chart (a), the male/female ratio piechart (b), the inhabitants ratio pie chart (c) and the land/water ratio pie chart.
